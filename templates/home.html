          <p>Why Stock Analytics?</p>
        </h3>
        <p>There are millions of questions that novice investors will have before investing in the stock market like if they will be able to make a profit, will the stock price rise, should they invest for the long term or short term, and much more. Apart from these questions, there are also many complex financial indicators that make the stock price fluctuate. To understand these indicators, they may need to have good knowledge and understanding of various frequently used terms and how they are being calculated. It may not always be easy to study all the formulas and understand every calculation related to a stock price. Most of them do not have such extensive knowledge and may need to dedicate a specific amount of time to study all the details.</p>
        <p>To help such investors, the idea being proposed here is to develop a product called <strong class="smallcaps">Stock Analytics</strong> that can guide them to invest in a particular stock</p>
        <p>The features are as follows:</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <ul>
              <li class="smallcaps"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Price Prediction</li>
              <li class="smallcaps"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Become familiar stock trading terms</li>
              <li class="smallcaps"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> PaperTrading</li>
              <li class="smallcaps"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> View correlation graphs</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12 pt-4 pt-lg-0 content" data-aos="fade-left" style="padding-left: 2em;">
        <p><strong class="smallcaps">Price Prediction: </strong>With the help of machine learning models, predicting the stock price by tracking its movement based on historical data collected</p>
        <p><strong class="smallcaps">Become familiar stock trading terms: </strong>This app provides daily tips to help a rookie trader become familiar with the stock market terms. It puts an effort to impart knowledge within the user so that they can be familiar with basic terminologies and even earn knowledge</p>
        <p><strong class="smallcaps">PaperTrading: </strong>A paper trade is a simulated trade that allows an investor to practice buying and selling without risking real money. Investors who want to practise trading would write their investment ideas on paper and follow the market movements, to see if their ideas panned out. This option is only for intraday (buy today sell today) and long term investment (buy today sell tomorrow/any time later)</p>
        <p><strong class="smallcaps">View correlation graphs: </strong>Plotting correlation graphs for several competitor stocks</p>
